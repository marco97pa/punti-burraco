# History

I have started writing this app at the age of 16, in 2014. My test device was an old and modded Android 4.0.3 phone.
I started making this app for personal use. After one year, I released it on the Google Play Store.
Now, in 2017, after a big rework of the app, I am publishing my code on GitHub.
