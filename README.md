# History

I have started writing this app at the age of 16, in 2014. My test device was an old and modded Android 4.0.3 phone. I started making this app for personal use. After one year, I released it on the Google Play Store.
Now, in 2017, after a big rework of the app, I am publishing my code on GitHub.

# Specs / Open-source libraries:

- Minimum **SDK 15**
- [**Android-CropImage**](https://github.com/lvillani/android-cropimage) for cropping profile images
- **Firebase** analytics, crash reporting, ads
- **Android Support Libraries**, the almighty ;)
- **AppCompat**, the power ;)
- **Android Custom Tabs**, to show the user Guide
