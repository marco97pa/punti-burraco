# Versioning

Just some information about how I manage the app version.

Note that first releases (from 1.0 to 2.8) were not following this pattern.

> Major.minor.fix

**Fix**: this number is related to a bug fix, a correction, polishing, or a minimal change. 

**Minor**: this number is related to a new feature. Every new feature or interface element increase this number.

**Major**: this number is increased when a new concept of the app is released, with a big rework of the core of the app
