      <h2 id="play">How to play Buraco</h2>
      <p><strong>Buraco</strong> is a card game for 2 players or pairs. The object is to create <strong>flushes of the same suit</strong> or groups of <strong>3 or more of the same cards</strong> to get more points than your opponents.</p>
      <p>The game is very popular in Italy and in Brazil with its different methods, but the most used is the Open Dirty mode</p>
      <p>It’s played with 2 French decks with wildcards. The games can be played at 2005 or 3000 points per game.</p>
      <p>This guide is based on the Open Dirty mode</p>

      <h3 id="deal">Dealing</h3>
      <p>11 cards are dealt to each player and two groups of 11 cards each are left aside, which are called “stock”. The other cards will become the deck from where the players pick up cards.</p>

      <h3 id="flow">Game play</h3>
      <p>The first player must take one card from the deck, and try to make combinations to place them on the playing area (minimum 3 cards). One can put down as many combinations as desired.</p>
      <p>When finishing, the player must mandatorily throw one card of his/her hand and lie it down faced-up in the center of the table (pile).</p>
      <p>At the beginning of their turn, each player has the option to take one card from the deck or stay with all the acculmulated cards in the pile to make the combinations (It’s compulsory to take them all from the deck).</p>
      <p>As well as making new combinations, you also must incorporate cards into the combinations you already have in play.</p>
     
      <h3 id="jokers">Wildcards</h3>
      <p>The <strong>twos and jokers</strong> have the function of wildcards and can be used in any combination.</p>
      <p>In a combination there can only be one wildcard. There can be 2 twos only if one of them has the function of a wildcard and the other its normal value.</p>
      <p>It is possible to replace a joker at stake for the correspondending card. In that case, the joker will be moved in the sequence having another value according to the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the 2 functioning as a joker has the same suit of the combination and it can replace the 2, it will not function as a joker anymore to take the place of the 2.</li>
        <li>If it is not possible, it will keep on functioning as a joker at the right end of the sequence (where the highest cards are placed).</li>
        <li>If it is not possible, it will keep on functioning as a joker at the left end (with the lowest cards).</li>
        <li>If the sequence is completed (from ace to ace), it is not possible to replace the joker.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="dead">The pot</h3>
      <p>At one side of the table, two piles with 11 cards each are reserved, they are called “stock”. When one of the players has no cards, he/she catches one of the piles of the stock. Each partner can only use one of the stocks in a game.</p>
      <p>When the cards of the deck finish, one of the piles of the “stock”, if there are any, will replace the deck.</p>

      <h3 id="can">Canastas</h3>
      <p>A <strong>canasta</strong> is formed when a combination of 7 or more cards is made.</p>
      <p>Depending on how they are formed, there are different types of canastas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dirty run:</strong> It is formed with the help of a joker.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear run:</strong> It is formed with no jokers.</li>
        <li><strong>Semi-clean run:</strong> It is a combination of 8 cards with the help of a joker</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text_light">Note: a dirty run can become a clear run when the 2 used as a joker can be moved to the position of the 2. If this is not possible (for example, if a combination has a joker), it can never be a natural canasta.</p>

      <h3 id="bat">Close</h3>
      <p>A player “closes” when he/she has no more cards in his/her hand after catching the stock. To be able to go out and end the game, it is necessary to dispose of one card on the pile.</p>

      <h3 id="score">Value of the plays</h3>
      <p>The points are scored the following way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3 to 7</strong>: 5 points</li>
        <li><strong>2 (joker)</strong>: 20 points</li>
        <li><strong>8 to king</strong>: 10 points</li>
        <li><strong>Ace</strong>: 15 points</li>
        <li><strong>Joker</strong>: 30 points</li>
        <li><strong>Final closing</strong>: 100 points</li>
        <li><strong>Dirty run</strong>: 100 points</li>
        <li><strong>Clear run</strong>: 200 points</li>
        <li><strong>Semi-clean run</strong>: 150 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also, not picking up the dead card 100 points are taken. The points of the cards that are left in your hand are also taken away.</p>

      <h3 id="end">End</h3>
      <p>The game ends when a player or pair gets the amount of points necessary to win (usually 2005 or 3000 points)</p>
