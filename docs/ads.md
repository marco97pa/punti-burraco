# Ads
This app uses ads to support development. It is based on [Google Admob](https://apps.admob.com/) platform.

The Admob app ID is not present on this repository for security reasons.
You can add your Admob app ID before building, following the [Firebase and Ads section](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-the-required-files-for-firebase-and-ads) of CONTRIBUTING.md

## I want to choose my ads preferences
You will be asked to choose between viewing personalized ads or non-personalized ads on the first launch.
You can change your preference on the Settings menu whenever you want.

## I want to remove Ads
If you build the app from the source and launch it on a device in DEBUG mode, you will see the "Developer Options" on the Settings menu.
From this section you can disable Ads.
Note that this option is not available on the RELEASE apk or Google Play Store version of the app.

## Can I pay an ad-free version of the app?
In the past I have made a PRO version of the app, but I don't want to split my userbase and let someone complain because the free app lacks of some features.
So I have choosen to use ads to all.
